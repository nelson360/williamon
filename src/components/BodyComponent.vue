<p>Chuck Norris has never blinked in his entire life. Never. M.C. Hammer learned the hard way that Chuck Norris can touch this. When Chuck Norris does a pushup, he’s pushing the Earth down. Chuck Norris can slam revolving doors. Chuck Norris beats rock, paper, scissors. Cannon balls, tanks, super destroyers, exploding stars — I could go on.
